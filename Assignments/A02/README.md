## Project Selection - Choose your DB
#### Due: Wednesday, Sep 4<sup>th</sup>

### Overview

Since we have Monday Sep 4<sup>th</sup> off for labor day, you have 9 days to research this assignment. Yes, I understand that this is labor day weekend. However, we need to start this early because this course will be all projects and presentations. For your projects and presentations to have any substance, you need time to research.

Looking at the list of topics from the syllabus briefly read a little about each one, and see which ones peak your interest. Also look [here](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) wich lists DB's by popularity. We are going to stay away from enterprise software (Oracle, Sql Server, DB2, Etc.) because we don't want to deal with "trial periods" and open source systems are typically easier to install and manage.

[This article](https://scalegrid.io/blog/2019-database-trends-sql-vs-nosql-top-databases-single-vs-multiple-database-use/) talks about the most popular Db's and how they are used compared to each other, or even in conjuction with each other. 

[This article](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2010/redis-tutorial/) is old, but it discussed `Redis` (a key value store DB) along with some typicall use cases. This is important becaues my goal for this semester is to create some simulations that "test" the performance of different data base implementations alone and in conjunction with each other. 

Lastly, I want you to look at `Docker` wich is software that allows you to run instances of many different things in a virtualized `container` type environment. If you go [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image) you can see some of the most popular container types (which a lot of them are databases).
