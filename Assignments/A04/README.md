## Flight Planner - Can we be the worst ever?
#### Due : TBD

### Overview


#### Part One
You are going to load flight data information onto the cs2 server under your database. Since you will be using a single database to organize all of your info, we will employ a naming convention to organize your tables. Phpmyadmin will "group" tables together with the same prefix. In [Flight Data](./flight_data) you will find 8 files, 4 with data and 4 with information about the data.
