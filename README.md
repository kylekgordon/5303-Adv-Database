### Topics

Typically database courses would involve `relational algebra` and `normal forms` and basically a theoretical side to RDBMS's. I've been teaching this as a survey of contemporary database choices along with projects to determine performance. So below is a list of databases that we will be looking at. 

- SQL / RDBMS / Relational databases
  - [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/)
  - [PostGres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [SqlIte](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- NoSQL / Non-relational databases
  - Document Stores
    - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - [CouchBase](https://www.couchbase.com/)
  - Wide Column Stores
    - [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
    - [Scylla](http://www.scylladb.com/)
    - [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)
  - Key-Value Stores
    - [Redis](https://redis.io/)
    - [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
  - Graph Databases
    - [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/)
  - Search Engine
    - [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/)
- API Querying
  - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

>**1**. Each student will give 2 presentations over topics of the professors choosing.
>
>**2**. Programming projects will be assigned. Any project turned in must include basic instructions, comments, file descriptions and of course must run.
>
>**3**. A final exam over general database topics will be given. As the semester progresses we will accumulate the necessary study materials from your projects and presentations, as well as my lessons.
>
>**4**. Plane ticket prices, events like weddings, or trips out of the country are not valid excuses for missing the final exam at its scheduled time. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students.
