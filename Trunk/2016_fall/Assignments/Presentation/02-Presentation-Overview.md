- A copy of your powerpoint presentation to be called: `dbname.pptx`  ( _riak.pptx_ or _hbase.pptx_ for example) will be in this folder.
- This folder will also contain your progress report(s).
- Any handouts, data files, instructions for any tasks will be in here.

## Presentation Overview
- Your presentation needs to last most of the class period, so plan on discussing your topic at length.
- Start by answering the questions that I posted for your topic, then expand my list as you find additional information that you find relevant or interesting.
- Graphics, Images, Example Code or anything visual will really help your presentation.
- Reading your slides is not good, so putting lots of bullets and text will degrade your presentation.
- A large portion of your talk is the hands on demonstration so make sure you practice not only your talk, but your demo.
- Each person should talk, but if one person wants to just control the slides I won't object. As long as the entire talk/demo is not dominated by a single person.
- There are two documents that are provided for you in this folder: [presentation_grade_rubric.md](./presentation_grade_rubric.md) and [presentation_grade_sheet.md](presentation_grade_sheet.md) to help you understand what is being graded. 
- A "grade sheet" will be handed to everyone in class so you can grade each other for each presentation.
