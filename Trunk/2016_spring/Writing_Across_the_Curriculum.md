### Writing Across the Curriculum Workshop – Spring 2014

#### _Part 1_
- Don’t allow direct quotes.  Require all cited material to be paraphrased then cite.
- All cited material MUST be followed by some analysis, commentary, application, etc. written by the student.  If there is not, then why did they include it?
- Clearly framing an assignment helps not only grading time but informs students of requirements. Give them the grading rubric.
- Allow for reading of student drafts
    - Respond with only 2 or 3 patterns of problems to work on
    - Send students to writing lab with assignment & draft
- Develop (write) in the following order:

>	Body → Conclusion → Introduction → Title

- The BODY must use an organizational strategy
    - Chronological
    - Strong to weak
    - Most popular to least popular
    - Expensive to cheap
    - This list is VERY long!
- Tie writing assignment to the objectives of the course.

#### _Part 2_
Three Part Sentences:  Well-formed sentences have 3 parts 1/2/3.
1. Subject/Main Point of the sentence
2. Strong verb (action)
3. New information related to subject
- The next sentence must refer back to the previous sentence in some way, etc… 
    - Mary called her mother on Sunday.  They discussed their plans for Christmas. Christmas dinner will be held at Grandmother Smith’s home.

___Avoiding Wordiness___
1. Avoid empty words, especially in sentence openers.  (that, in order to, for example)
2. Cut down on intensifiers (very, extremely, really, totally)
3. Avoid passive voice. (Passive – A poem was written by Bob. Better - Bob wrote a poem.)
4. Choose specific words over general (College students like pizza. NOT - Many people like pizza.), concrete over abstract (I am a good candidate. NOT - I believe I am a good candidate.)
5. Keep a forbidden word list.
6. Use Strong Verbs.

___List of “Bad Guys” – weak verbs, forbidden words___
- WEAK verbs:  is, are, were, was, be, am – can, could, may, might, will
- WEAK Prepositions: of, for, to, by (by indicated passive voice most of the time)
- Pronouns that do not refer to nouns:  there, it (The library has 10,000 books. NOT - There are many books in the library. ) 
- Generalizations: 
    - say students, not people; say buildings not things
    - avoid: many, most, always, everyone, everybody
    - avoid: area, field, discipline because they are usually followed by of.  Pre-med students major in biology. NOT – Many students who are going to med school study the discipline of biology. (Notice several broken guidelines.)
    - avoid:  fact, example
- Avoid words ending in –tion – these are usually abstract  
- Avoid intensifiers – used to exaggerate, fluff: very, really, extremely, totally
- Avoid “claims” – prove with facts:  important, crucial, significant, key, vital, essential, believe, feel – People who eat healthy lose weight.  NOT – It is important for people to eat healthy to lose weight.  NOT - I believe people should eat healthy to lose weight.
- Avoid unprovable cause & effect:  avoid words cause, causes, caused, because (of). 
- Avoid either-or: seldom only 2 options
- Often can remove THAT, IN SPITE OF and IN ORDER without changing the meaning

___Removing Wordiness:___  Write first for content without concern for wordiness.  Then edit.  Read each sentence aloud and consider the guidelines.

#### _Part 3_

Passive Voice
Components:

1. The actual subject of the sentence (the one doing something) is replaced by the direct or indirect object and the object takes on the grammatical (not logical) role of the subject.
2. A form of the verb be (is, are, was, were) and an appropriate main (active) verb (ending in –en, -ed) are added, but the original tense remains the same
3. The preposition by is added followed by the main (logical) subject.  The prepositional phrase beginning with by usually occurs at the end of the sentence and can usually be omitted.
4. Examples
    - a. Passive voice:  The dog was kicked (by Bob).
    - b. Active voice: Bob kicked the dog.
- Having a form of verb be does not make passive voice
    - Active voice: Bob is a teacher.
- Passive voice is acceptable in some circumstances.  Exceptions include technical or scientific reports.
    - Passive voice:  The slide was studied under the microscope.
    - Active voice:  The lab technician studied the slide under the microscope.  
    - In this case, it is not important who did the action so passive voice is acceptable.
    - Passive but appropriate: The new attendance policy will have to be improved.

__Making the Subject the Subject__ (S=S) 
- By removing excessive wordiness at the beginning of sentences & removing passive voice
- By clearly identifying the logical subject of the sentence and moving it to front of sentence
- Example 1
    - Weak & wordy: It is obvious to the reader that Frankenstein enjoyed creating the second creature. (Grammatical subject is It but logical subject is Frankenstein. Also, avoid using the word that.)
    - Strong & to the point: Frankenstein obviously enjoyed creating the second creature.
    - To correct the student’s paper put ( ) around wordy beginning and note S=S (make subject the subject): (It is obvious to the reader that) Frankenstein enjoyed creating the second creature.
- Example 2
    - Weak & wordy: (It should be America’s responsibility) (to provide for the education of) the public.
    - Strong & to the point:  America should educate the public.

Excellent Reference:  “Writing with Style” by John Trimble – practices what he writes and recommends using small words, not big ones!
Poor reference but heavily used:  “The Elements of Style” by Strunk & White – they give excellent advice on style but totally ignore it in the book and do not know grammar
