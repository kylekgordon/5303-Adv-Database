Below is a brainstorm of questions from me. 
It will flow logically like a presentation should, but I am brainstorming, so if something doesn’t make sense please come clarify

I will use “THEM” and “THEY” meaning “No Sql” and “Rdbms” together.
- What is Big Data and the “No Sql” movement? (just an overview and loose definitions, because you will be more specific in comparing THEM )
    - Define all the terms:
        - Big Data
        - No Sql
        - Rdbms
- Describe the differences between THEM. (now you can be more specific in comparing the two).  Below are some questions that may help you describe the differences.
    - Use companies   (like mysql postgres oracle mongodb redis) when describing differences
    - When should we use one or the other?
    - What types of businesses or platforms use either of THEM
        - Data companies? Gaming companies. Companies that have so much data they can’t process it?
        - Is it just for data analytics and or data mining? Or can it be used for business and e-commerce?
    - Is there ever a clear cut decision between one of THEM?
- Big Data tends to be paired with No Sql, is this always the choice? Are there alternatives allowing companies to stick with Rdbms?
- Are there any Hybrid databases (both No Sql and Rdbms)?
- Are there any Rdbms’s that are made for big data?
- Conclusions


- Don’t forget to discuss performance!
- And try to use images when describing things. 

I found this presentation:

Theres a bunch more on that site. It’s ok to use others materials. Just cite them.
