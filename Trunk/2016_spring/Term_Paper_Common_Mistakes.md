## Term Paper Common Mistakes

- Abstract on a separate page before content, and after title page.
- Don't assume reader knows the meaning of a word (e.g. mapreduce). If it is not general computer science knowledge (or very common in a field of computer science) then it needs to be explained or defined.
- First time you use an acronym, define it (e.g. "... in the Hadoop File System (HDFS) ... " then you can use the acronym on its own.
- Page numbers at upper right (except first page, where its bottom middle).
- When stating a fact, like "90% of the data in the world has been created in the last two years", you need to have a reference and a citation.
- Make sure you transition from one section to the next. Don't just start a new sub topic without transitioning.
- Try to use the authors name when referring to a paper (at least the first time) (e.g. "In [3] Sharma states ..."). This is Dr. Passos' preferred method.
- If the paper has two or three authors try to list them all (e.g. "In [3] Sharma and Smith state ...") (three might be pushing it). If there are more, refer to them in this fashion: "In [3] Sharma et al. state that ...".
- Don't use the title of the paper when referring to it, just the reference number.
- Place your references on separate page at the end of your paper, not right after the last paragraph.
- References are ordered alphabetically by the last name of the first author.
