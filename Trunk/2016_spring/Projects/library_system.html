<a NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000"></a>Assignment 3: Demonstration</h1>

<h1>
<font size=+0>In this assignment you will be demonstrating the code that
performs the interactions listed below.</font></h1>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>You should work in pairs.&nbsp; Pairs have to come from the
same section.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>You can use the spec/design document of either member of
the pair, or some combination of the two to create a spec/design document
for the system you de,pmstrate.&nbsp; The document will be collected at
the time of the demo.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>The interactions are divided into two sets:&nbsp;set A =
{withdraw, return, hold, pay},&nbsp; set B = {add, remove, move, search,
next-day}.&nbsp; Each member of the group will be responsible for one set
and the grade for a member will be (partially) based on the performance
of the set that member implements.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Demos will be held in the last week of the semester.</font></li>
</ul>
<a NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000"></a><b><font size=+3>Assignment 2:
Design Document</font></b>
<br>In this assignment, you will be writing a design document for the library
database system which contains:
<ol>
<li>
Give an E-R diagram&nbsp; for the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use arrows or thick
lines to represent constraints appropriately. Write down your assumptions
if necessary.</li>

<li>
Translate the E-R diagram to the relational model: <u>all SQL CREATE&nbsp;
statements must be provided</u>. Specify primary key, <u>candidate key</u>,
and foreign key constraints.</li>

<li>
<u>Give a description of the meaning of all attributes</u>.</li>

<li>
<u>Explain how you intend to enforce each integrity constraint:&nbsp; in
the schema or by checking in the code.&nbsp; If the latter, in which interactions
does the check need to be made?</u></li>

<li>
<u>Specify all functional dependencies</u>.</li>

<li>
<u>For each table, state what normal form it is in and justify your answer</u>.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
Due date: <u>11/8/2001</u>.&nbsp; Hand in a hardcopy in class.</li>

<li>
Read the following project description again very carefully since some
revisions <u>(underlined)</u> have been made.</li>

<a NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000"></a>Introduction</h2>
The objectives of the library system are to allow patrons to:
<dl compact="">
<ul>
<li>
withdraw and return books</li>

<li>
search the library's books</li>

<li>
pay overdue charges</li>
</ul>
</dl>
&nbsp;and librarians to:
<ul>
<li>
add/delete books to/from the library's holding</li>

<li>
move books from one shelf of the library to another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000"></a>Information to be Contained in
the System</h2>

<dl compact="">
<dl compact="">
<ol compact="">
<li>
The system shall contain information about each valid patron of the system:
<i>name,
password, address</i>, <i>Id</i>, unpaid <i>fine</i>s, the identity of
each book the patron has currently withdrawn and its <i>due-date</i>. It
is assumed that the information about all patrons is part of the initial
state of&nbsp; the database (no interactions are needed to add or delete
patrons from the system).</li>

<li>
The system shall contain information about each librarian: <i>name, password,
address</i>, <i>Id</i>.&nbsp; It is assumed that the information about
all librarians is part of the initial state of&nbsp; the database (no interactions
are needed to add or delete librarians from the system).&nbsp; Librarians
can be patrons.</li>

<li>
The system shall contain information about each book in the library's holdings:
<i>isbn</i>
number, <i>title</i>,&nbsp;<i> author</i>(s), <i>year</i> (of publication),
copy <i>number</i>, <i>shelf-Id</i>, <u><i>publisher, </i>publisher's<i>
city</i></u><i>, </i>current <i>status</i> (on-loan, on-shelf, on-hold,
on-loan-and-on-hold), the date on which the book entered loan and/or hold
status.&nbsp; For books on loan the system shall contain the
<i>Id</i>
of the patron involved.&nbsp; For books on loan and overdue the system
shall contain the date on which the last reminder letter was sent.&nbsp;
For books on hold the system shall contain an ordered list of <i>Id</i>s
of patrons who have requested hold status.</li>

<li>
<u>The system shall contain the year of birth of each author</u>.</li>

<li>
The system shall contain information about each shelf in the library: s<i>helf-Id,
capacity </i>(number of books that it can hold).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>The database shall satisfy the following integrity constraints.</blockquote>

<dl compact="">
<ol compact="">
<ol compact="">
<li>
<u>A patron can request a book that is currently withdrawn.&nbsp; This
fact needs to be stored in the database, and when the book is returned
it should be placed on hold status for at most 3 days </u>(<u>the count
starts when the book is returned)</u>.&nbsp; If after removing a book from
hold status as a result of this constraint, the hold list is empty, the
book reverts to the on shelf status.</li>

<li>
<u>A patron cannot withdraw a book if his/her unpaid fines exceed $5.</u></li>

<li>
A patron cannot withdraw more than 2 books at any one time.</li>

<li>
The date on which the last reminder letter for an overdue book was sent
cannot be more than one week old.</li>

<a NAME="SECTION00014000000000000000"></a>Interactions with the System</h2>

<blockquote>In order to perform the following interactions with the system,
a user&nbsp; must login&nbsp; first with a valid <i>Name</i> and <i>password</i>.&nbsp;
If login is successful the user's <i>Id</i> is returned by the DBMS to
the application program. All subsequent interactions are assumed to have
been initiated by that user until the session completes (the user logs
out) .&nbsp; Since <i>Id</i> is used to identify the user in these interactions,
the application should retain <i>Id</i> until the end of the session, supplying
it as a parameter when necessary to the DBMS.&nbsp; <u>The session is ended
with logout, </u>at which point the application can discard <i>Id</i> and
the next interaction must be a new login.</blockquote>

<dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>withdraw - (patron)</b></dt>
</dl>

The purpose of this interaction is to allow a patron to withdraw a book.
<u><i>title
</i>and
one of the <i>author </i>names are supplied at the screen</u> . The interaction
fails if:</dd>

The purpose of this interaction is to allow a patron to place a book that
is currently withdrawn or being held (for a different patron) on hold.
<u><i>title
</i>and
one of the<i> author </i>names are supplied at the screen</u>. An ordered
list is maintained of all patrons who have placed the book on hold. The

<dd>
<b>return - (patron)</b></dd>

<dd>
The purpose of this interaction is to allow a patron to return a book that
he/she has withdrawn. <i>t<u>itle </u></i><u>and<i> </i>one of the<i> author
</i>names
are supplied at the screen.</u> If the book is overdue, the patron's charge
record is updated by an amount of $1 a day. If the book is on hold, a call
is made to the patron at the head of the hold list (you can ignore the
call in the transaction, but you should record the date that the call was
made). The interaction fails if the book is not recorded as being withdrawn
by that patron.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dl>
<dt>
<b>add - ( librarian)</b></dt>

The purpose of this interaction is to allow a librarian to add a new book
to the library's holding.&nbsp; <u><i>isbn, title, year, author</i>(s)<i>,
</i>and
<i>shelf-Id</i>
(of the shelf on which the book is to be stored) are supplied at the screen</u>.

<ul>
<li>
The initiator is not a librarian (one implementation of this is that your
interface ensures that only a librarian can initate this interaction).</li>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>move - (librarian)</b></dt>

The purpose of this interaction is to allow a librarian to move a book
from one shelf to another. <u><i>title, </i>one of the <i>author
</i>names<i>,</i>
and copy <i>number </i>(to identify the book) and <i>shelf-Id</i> (to identify
the new shelf) are supplied</u>. The interaction fails if</dd>

The purpose of this interaction is to allow a patron to search for a book
in the library's holdings.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>One or more of the following:
<i>title,
author, year</i> are supplied at the screen</u>. <u>Either title or author
must be supplied, however the title need not be complete - a substring
of the title might be supplied - and only a single author can be supplied
(even though books can have multiple authors).&nbsp; A range of years can
be specified.&nbsp; For example, the search "list all books with the word
`hiking' in the title written by Smith (there might be coauthors) between
1995 and 2000.&nbsp; The title, author and year of all books that satisfy
the search criterion are&nbsp; output.</u></dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dl>
<dt>
<b>pay - (patron)</b></dt>
</dl>

<dd>
The purpose of this interaction is to allow a patron to pay a fine.&nbsp;
The amount of payment is deducted from the balance owed. <u>The&nbsp; amount
of the payment is input at the screen</u>. Any excess is considered a donation
to the library.&nbsp; The amount of fine remaining is displayed <u>on the
screen</u>.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dl>
<dt>
<b>next-day - (librarian)</b></dt>
</dl>

<dd>
The purpose of this interaction is to allow a librarian to record the fact
that another day has passed.&nbsp; The interaction fails if the initiator
is not a librarian.&nbsp; Actions which depend on the date (e.g., removing
a book from hold status) should be automatically triggered by this interaction.</dd>
