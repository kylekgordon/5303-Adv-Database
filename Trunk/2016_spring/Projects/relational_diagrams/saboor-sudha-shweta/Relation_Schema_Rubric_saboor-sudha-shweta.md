| Redundancy(x2)     | Relation schemas include no redundant data without offering an explanation of the design requirements (e.g., performance) that indicate why redundancy is desirable. | Relation schemas include some redundant data. In most cases an explanation is given for why the redundancy is desirable.            | Relation schemas include significant duplication of data. No explanation is given for why the redundancy is desirable.   | 5 (10)            |
