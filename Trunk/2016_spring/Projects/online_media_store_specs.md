# Media Sharing Site 

## Spring 2015

### Description

Your going to create an online media sharing site that lets users upload and download media. They can pay money to gain access to media files, or they can download files for free on a tit for tat basis (basically you can download a song for every song you upload, or download a movie for every movie you upload).


### Specifications / Requirements:

The users of your system will be the customers that upload media, purchase media and or download media 
Pirate suppliers that capture  media files and upload these to your web site 
Customer representatives who process customer orders and provide other customer-related services
The sites manager


The data items required for the music-store database can be classified into six categories: 
- media
- customers
- employees
- Transactions
- suppliers
- orders

Your database system should provide controlled access to the data by distinguishing between the different types of users: 
- manager
- customer representatives
- customers

This classification does not imply any particular table arrangement. You are responsible for arranging the data items into tables, determining the relationships among tables and identifying the key attributes. 

You should include indices in your tables to speed up query processing. You should base your choice of indices on the type and expected frequency of the queries. Finally, you should specify and enforce integrity constraints on the data.

You will create your relational model using Mysql Workbench or Phpmyadmin Designer.
