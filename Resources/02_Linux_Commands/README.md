## TL;DR Necessary Commands

| Directory Commands         | explanation                                           |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `cd dirname`              | change directory into `dirname`                       |
| `cd ..`                   | change directory into parent directory                |
| `cd ../somedir`           | change directory into parent then `somedir`           |
|                           |                                                       |
| `mkdir dirname`           | make a directory called `dirname`                     |
| `mkdir -p /one/two/three` | the `-p` will create all dirs necessary in the path   |
|                           | In this case `one` and `two` will get created if they |
|                           | don't exist already.                                  |
